A handoff is the process of transferring an active call or data session from one cell in a cellular network to another, or from one channel within a cell to another. 
Cellular networks are made up of cells, each of which can provide telecommunications services to customers roaming through the network. Each cell has a limited region 
and number of subscribers it can serve. A well-executed handoff is essential for providing continuous service to a caller or data session user. Using Machine learning 
algorithms the present methodology examines the accuracies generated by three popular decision-making algorithms namely Logistic Regression, Decision trees, Random 
Forests.
